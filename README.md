# XrmToolBox.CustomChannelCreator


This is an **XrmToolBox** plugin that allows the easy creation of **Custom Channels for Customer Insights Journeys**.

From this plugin you will create a solution, an entity for the channel instance, the required message parts and the channel definition.

It is necessary to have created the Custom API that will perform the channel action before attempting to create the Custom Channel.

Once created, it can be customized like any other dataverse table and can be used normally.
